# parser

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Summary

The Parser's role is to take a string and construct an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
which is independent of the models configured. It is "what is the user trying to
ask for" without knowing what can be provided.

## Building

Run `nx build parser` to build the library.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test parser` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
