# collector

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Summary

The Collector's role is to resolve data. It instructs individual sources
to resolve the sub-queries they've been delegated, and then combines and
transforms the results into the format the query demands.

## Building

Run `nx build collector` to build the library.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test collector` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
